This is the vrpn_client_ros package that we got from here : https://github.com/ros-drivers/vrpn_client_ros/tree/indigo-devel

We basically modified it to be compatible with our coordinate system transformation while we are data streaming from Optitrack to ROS
As Optitrack has y up coordinate system and ROS is a basic z up system.
